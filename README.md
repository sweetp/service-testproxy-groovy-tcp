This service shows you how to call other sevices in a TCP service.

The service uses a [base class](https://github.com/sweetp/base-groovy-tcp)
for TCP communication, look at that
project for more information about TCP services.
Since groovy lives in the JVM it is recommended to build a jvm service.

For basic information see
[boilerplate service](https://github.com/sweetp/service-boilerplate-groovy).
